```


5 - Start developing your project and we wish you the best ;)


# Commiting
You may have noticed we are using pre-commit that checks many things
and lowers the risks of implementing disasters.
pre-commit checks before you commit your changes
and if anything goes wrong, you cannot commit.
Fix the errors and try to commit again and you're good to go.
If you want to run pre-commit without commiting you can run:
```bash
pre-commit run -a
```
